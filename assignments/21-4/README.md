# Assignment 3: Radix/Bucket Sort hybrid

## Program Description
Implement the combined O(n) radix/bucket sort as described in class. "divide" the input by radix, bucket sort (with no insertion sort step) once for each radix starting from the least significant. Make sure that your overall implementation is O(n). You may use your (suitably modified if necessary) linked list from assignment #1, a linked list or dynamic array that you code for this assignment, or a standard library dynamic array or sequence container (such as the STL Vector in C++, or ArrayList for Java) for your buckets.

## Input
The input to your program will an unspecified number of entries. Each entry is a non-negative integer containing nine (zero padded) digits ( this means that the integer may have either leading or trailing zeros), one per line. Read your input from STDIN.

## Output
Send the values, one per line, as they were input (all nine digits including leading zeroes, if any), sorted in ascending order, to STDOUT. The only output of your program is the numeric results. (i.e. don't output your name, assignment number, prompts etc.)

## What you turn in
Put all of the source code files (.cpp, .h, makefile if C++, .java, etc.) but no executables, binaries, compiler, or data files (omit .o, "a.out" , .class files etc.) in a folder named as shown above in the home directory of your account on pengo. Please don't include any sub-folders.
