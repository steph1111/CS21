# Lab hours: Week 5s
**Total Hours:** 8.5

## Rewrote quick sort structure in Java (1.50 hours)
I rewrote my quick sort program in Java to learn the language.

## Python cyclic bidirectional iterator data structure (2.00 hours)
Created a python type which allows for bidirectional iteration with `next()` and `prev()`. If there is no next/prev element, it wraps around in a cyclic manor.

## Python ROS2 and PyQt bridge data structure (5.00 hours)
Created a data structure which acts as a bridge between ROS2 (robot operating system 2) and PyQt. This bridge allows for safe communication and transfer of data between the ROS and PyQt thread.
