# Lab hours: Week 1
**Total Hours:** 4.25

## Created a queue data structure implementation (0.5 hour)
Using the doubly linked list class, used composition to create a queue data structure with `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, and `isEmpty()` functions.

## Vim configuration (1.5 hours)
Re-learned `vim` commands and configured `~/.vimrc` on my Pengo account.

## Started rewriting linked list data structure in Java (2.25 hours)
I have never written anything in Java before and I figured this would be a good opportunity to learn the language.
